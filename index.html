        <h1>My Skills</h1>
        <p class="lead"> In the Front-End Dev 1 class, I gained fundamental skills in web development by delving into the basics of HTML and CSS. The course provided a solid foundation for creating and structuring web content, as HTML became a familiar language for crafting the skeleton of web pages. I learned to organize information effectively, creating headings, paragraphs, and lists. Additionally, the class introduced me to the world of styling through CSS, where I grasped the principles of layout, color, and typography. Understanding the box model and the cascading nature of styles allowed me to enhance the visual appeal of web pages. Overall, Front-End Dev 1 equipped me with essential tools to kickstart my journey in web development, laying the groundwork for more advanced topics in the field.</p>
